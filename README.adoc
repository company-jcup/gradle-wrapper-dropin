== About
If you have any project with an build.gradle, but without a gradle wrapper, you can use this as a dropin:

NOTE: just download the files as zip from github, extract and copy all files here inside root folder of
      the target project and you are done. It will have automatically
      gradle 7.0 as wrapper and also as build tool dependency. For example call `./gradlew tasks`
